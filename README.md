# Bumper-Balls

Welcome to Bumper Balls!

Like my favorite childhood carnival activity, but in augmented reality and the cars are balls.

This communicates with the BallServer program written in Go to provide a multiplayer experience.

This is the largest software system I've ever written, and I learned lots in my toil.
